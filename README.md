### Overview
Flutter Ayatnesia Qur'an Search is a mobile application developed using Flutter, which serves as my final project for completing a Computer Science degree at Nahdlatul Ulama University, Blitar.

This application features a search capability for the text of Qur'anic verses in Indonesian translation, utilizing both lexical and semantic similarity measurements. Flutter Ayatnesia is designed to meet the needs of users looking for relevant Qur'anic verses, whether based on keyword similarity or semantic meaning, by leveraging the Al-Qur'an dataset provided by the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs (Kemenag). This makes it easier for the Indonesian public to find verses that best match their needs.

The search feature and Qur'anic data management are integrated through a REST API that I developed in the project "[FastAPI Ayatnesia](https://github.com/utrodus/fastapi-ayatnesia)." The Qur'an dataset, which includes Arabic text, translations, and brief interpretations, is sourced from the [Al Qur'an Kemenag](https://quran.kemenag.go.id/), ensuring that the data is valid and reliable.

**Key Features:**
- **Lexical Search:** Find Qur'anic verses based on keywords or phrases using TF-IDF and cosine similarity methods.
- **Semantic Search:** Discover verses based on the meaning of words using word embeddings with the FastText model.
- **Combined Search:** A blend of lexical and semantic searches that allows for searching verses using both keywords and semantic meanings simultaneously.
- **Relevance Calculation:** Search results include relevance scores based on three methods: lexical, semantic, and combined.
- **Brief Interpretation by Kemenag:** The application also features brief interpretations by Kemenag, making it easier for users to read and understand the interpretation of each verse.
